🧑‍💻 Ajinkya Angal
Robotics Learner • Ubuntu Linux Explorer • ROS2 Beginner

Hi! I’m Ajinkya, someone who loves understanding how things work — especially robots. I’m currently learning and experimenting with ROS2 on Ubuntu 22.04, and exploring the fundamentals of robotics step by step.

I’m not someone with a long list of projects yet, but I’m extremely curious and I learn fast. I don’t like feeling clueless about something, so I keep pushing until I understand it fully.

🚀 What I’m Currently Learning

ROS2 basics on Ubuntu (nodes, topics, packages)

How simulation tools like Gazebo/Ignition work

Basics of robot mechanics and hardware

Linux workflow & terminal usage

Programming fundamentals through Python and C++

Core math for robotics (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Statistics)

🤖 Why Robotics?

I genuinely enjoy:

Understanding how sensors, motors, and microcontrollers come together

Learning how robots “think” using software

Exploring the mathematics behind autonomous systems

Building intuition by experimenting and breaking things until they make sense

Robotics feels like the perfect mix of hardware, coding, physics, and logic — everything I enjoy.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies I’m Getting Comfortable With

Ubuntu 22.04 (my main OS for robotics work)

ROS2 Humble

Python

C++ basics

VS Code

Git & GitHub

Arduino (beginner-level tinkering)

📚 My Mindset

“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” — Wayne Gretzky

I’m driven by curiosity, not perfection.
I prefer learning things deeply, not rushing.
And I believe robotics is something I’ll grow into — one concept at a time.

🌱 What’s Next?

I plan to start working on:

My first proper robotics project using ROS2

Building simple robots with sensors and Arduino

Creating structured notes and repos for concepts I learn

Eventually moving into navigation, control, and perception

When I start real projects, I’ll update this README accordingly.
