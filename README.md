## 🌌 About Me  
Hey! I’m **Ajinkya**, someone who loves figuring out how things work — especially robots.  
Right now I’m in the early stages of exploring:

- 🐧 **Ubuntu Linux 22.04**
- 🔁 **ROS2 (Humble)**
- ⚙️ **Robotics fundamentals**
- 🔢 **Math for robotics** (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Stats)
- 🧠 **Programming in Python & C++**

I don’t have big robotics projects yet —  
but I’m building the foundation *properly and honestly*, one concept at a time.

---

## 🔥 What I’m Currently Learning  
- ROS2 nodes, topics, workspaces  
- Launch files & basic simulation workflows  
- Linux system navigation + CLI power tools  
- Writing cleaner Python + learning modern C++  
- Sensor basics (motors, IR/Ultrasonic, microcontrollers)

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy  
- I hate feeling clueless — so I keep digging until things make sense  
- I prefer *understanding deeply* rather than just copying commands  
- I learn by experimenting, breaking stuff, fixing stuff  
- Robotics is the perfect blend of hardware + logic + math, and that’s why I love it  

---

## 🌱 Growing My Robotics Journey  
Soon, I’ll start working on:

- My first robot inside ROS2 simulation  
- A simple hardware robot using Arduino + sensors  
- Organized repos documenting my learning path  
- Eventually: navigation, control, and perception  

---

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
I love robotics so much that even understanding *why a sensor behaves weird* feels fun.
